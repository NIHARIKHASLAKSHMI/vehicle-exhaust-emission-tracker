Proactive Monitoring and Prediction of Vehicle Exhaust Emissions for Enhanced Environmental Health
Abstract 
Exhaust Emission Index (EEI) quantifies the rate of air pollutants emitted by a vehicle, with higher emissions correlating to poorer air quality. Traditional emission control methods, such as the Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificate, provide static test results rather than dynamic assessments of vehicle health. As vehicle numbers increase, the need for advanced solutions to monitor and predict exhaust emissions in real-time has become crucial. This project introduces the Emission Tracker, an innovative system utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to address this need. The Emission Tracker employs an LSTM model deployed on a central server to analyze vehicle carbon emission data, predicting trends in the Vehicle Exhaust Emission Index (VEEI). The system features a web-based dashboard that provides an intuitive user interface for visualizing emissions data. Through location-based insights, users gain a comprehensive understanding of emission patterns, which supports informed decision-making. The Emission Tracker not only enables real-time monitoring but also offers predictive analytics to forecast future emission trends. This proactive approach aids in implementing timely interventions, ultimately contributing to improved air quality and enhanced public health by fostering environmental sustainability.
